        <p>
          Game Changer, by Neal Shusterman, is a book about a boy called Ash who
          plays football in his American school. This is the story of Ash and
          his experience travelling through different universes that are each
          similar but not like his own. For example, in one of them stop signs
          are blue, but in the next, segregation still exists in America.

        <p>
          This is an awesome book, and is my favourite of the 10 books. I really
          like it because it's fun whilst also highlighting some of the
          important issues in society like racism, abuse, sexism and lots more.
          It does this in a unique way of travelling through different universes
          and has interesting and quirky characters that you can relate to.
